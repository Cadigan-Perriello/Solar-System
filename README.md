# Solar-System
This project incorporates a solar system simulation with all 8 planets. The plants sare sized proportional to each other with the scientific proportions in the solar system. When you click on each planet it includes either a visual effect or simulation based on the planet. For example, Saturn incorporates moving rings made up of an array of point objects. The Mars Planet has a simulation regarding the colonization of Mars when you click on the space bar. The simulation also incorporates glowing stars on the main page that 'glow' by growing and shrinking by a small amount at a fast right. The Uranus Planet uses the same rings as Saturn, except they go vertically, as the planet's rings also go in that direction.
