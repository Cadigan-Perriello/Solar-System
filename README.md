# Solar-System
This project incorporates a solar system simulation with all 8 planets. The planets are sized proportional to each other with the scientific proportions in the solar system, including the sun. When you click on each planet it includes either a visual effect or simulation based on the planet. The simulation also incorporates glowing stars on the main page that 'glow' by growing and shrinking by a small amount at a fast right. The project also includes a button in the top left corner that will bring you back to the main solar system page. 
## Mercury
Mercury has a moon, proportionally sized to its actual moon, rotating around the planet. The moon is a point object. 
## Venus
Venus includes a firework lava effect coming out of the planet, representing Venus' fiery environment. The fireworks are arrays of point objects going out in random directions from a central point.
## Earth 
Earth has cartoon rocket ships coming off of the planet to represent our space travel. The rockets utilize the Venus firework code to make the rocket fuel.
## Mars
Mars has a simulation illustrating the future possible colonization of Mars that appears when you click on the space bar. 
## Jupiter
Jupiter has a simulation of the giant red spot/storm on Jupiter's surface. This code uses two arrays of point objects rotating around a central point.
## Saturn
Saturn incorporates moving rings made up of an array of point objects, rotating around the planet. 
## Uranus 
The Uranus Planet uses the same rings as Saturn, except they go vertically, as the planet's rings also go in that direction. 
## Neptune
Neptune has a moving stars simulation, making the user appear to be moving through space. This represents how far out in space Neptune is. The stars are point objects that grow as they have been on the screen for larger periods of time, appearing to get closer to the user.
